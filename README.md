Data catalogs made easy. The Data Cataloginator is written in Python and built using open source projects like FastAPI, Lunr.js, Pydantic, Jinja2 and Bootstrap. The project's goal is to keep everything simple, lightweight, modular and as easy to extend as possible. All data aspects are anchored in JSON from the data model to the search index.

### Features

ðŸ”Ž **Search** - Lunr.js based search index

ðŸ’½ **Data** - Pydantic/JSON Schema compatible data model

ðŸ¤– **API** - FastAPI based REST API with Swagger UI and GraphQL support paired with GraphiQL

ðŸ“„ **Website** - Common HTML Jinja2 templating for easy customization

## Getting started

__Requirements__

The [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) file lists required python packages for running the Data Cataloginator.

__Installation notes__

Pygraphviz is a difficult install. You can try:

```sh
python3 -m pip install \
                --config-settings="--global-option=build_ext" \
                --config-settings="--global-option=-I$(brew --prefix graphviz)/include/" \
                --config-settings="--global-option=-L$(brew --prefix graphviz)/lib/" \
                pygraphviz
```

__Data Cataloginating__

The commands to data cataloginate a .csv of example data into a running, searchable data catalog are all in the Makefile.

However, we have found that some commands do not execute unless you run them on the commandline. We suggest that you run each of the commands in the Makefile individually from the commandline and verify that they executed. 

In practice, if you have a new data file and want to create a new catalog:
```	
rm data/individual_json/*.json
rm app/static/idx.json
rm idx.json
rm *.pyc

python3 scripts/to_json.py

python3 scripts/build_search.py
cp idx.json app/static/idx.json

datamodel-codegen --input data/records.json --input-file-type json --output scripts/data_model.py --output-model-type pydantic_v2.BaseModel

python3 scripts/to_pydantic.py
mv ./data/diagram.png app/static/images/diagram.png
echo "Done âœ…"

```

If you just want to run the existing catalog on your local machine, navigate to the app directory and then run uvicorn as follows:

```
cd app
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Copy and paste the address that appears into your web browser to run the catalog.

## Hosting

A python server is needed for deployment. It's setup with Uvicorn.
