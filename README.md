Data catalogs made easy. The Data Cataloginator is written in Python and built using great open source projects like FastAPI, Lunr.js, Pydantic, Jinja2 and Bootstrap. The projects goal is to keep everything simple, lightweight, modular and as easy to extend as possible. All data aspects are anchored in JSON from the data model to the search index.
